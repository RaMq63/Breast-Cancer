# Breast-Cancer Classifier
# Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify breast cancer tumors as either benign or malignant based on various features. The dataset used for training and evaluation is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
# Dataset
The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. These features describe characteristics of cell nuclei present in the image. The dataset consists of 30 features, such as mean radius, mean texture, mean perimeter, etc.
